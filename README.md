# Brick Game with a twist

A Breakout-like game but with a small twist at the end of the stage.
Destroy all blocks to find out what the twist is!

Made with [TIC-80][1] as an entry for the first [Fennel][2] [game jam][3].

You can play it [here][4].

## Description

This is my first, more or less, complete game.
I wanted to try making games for quite some time but never had enough momentum, so a goal for this project mainly was to put myself together and finally start with something complete with graphics, sound, and various powerups that alter gameplay a bit.
Hope the results are fun!

## Instructions

Movement: <kbd>left</kbd>, <kbd>right</kbd>
Launch ball: <kbd>up</kbd>
Retry: <kbd>A</kbd> (usually <kbd>z</kbd> on keyboard)

Hitting blocks gives you 10 points, and destroying a block grants 100.
Each powerup also counts for 100 points.
Collect 1000 points to earn one more life!

## Powerups

- Big Time - twice the size, twice the damage!

- One ball is fine, but three is better!

- You're now long (but not for long)

- Slowdown - permanently decreases the ball's speed

## Not so powerups

- Speedup - permanently increases the ball's speed

- Decrease board Length

(they still give you 100 points, so you might want them depending on your score)
